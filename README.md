# Introduction to security

This course teaches students cybersecurity fundamentals by combining penetration testing with defense strategies. Using an innovative blend of lectures and practical tutorials, students engage in highly interactive classes. Each new concept is immediately reinforced with hands-on exercises, allowing students to apply what they have learned in real time.

Throughout the semester, the course integrates both attack and defense techniques. In realistic scenarios accessed via a cyber range, students will practice a wide range of skills: reconnaissance, scanning, exploiting vulnerabilities, privilege escalation, lateral movement, exfiltration, malware analysis, network security forensics, binary reversing, log analysis, intrusion detection systems, honeypots, and applications of machine learning and AI in cybersecurity.
